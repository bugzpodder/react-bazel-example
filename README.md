Steps to run the sample:

Bazel is installed via npm, so a separate install is no longer needed.

It's not required to run yarn install since Bazel will do it for you. You may still want to do it for editor integration though.

1. yarn start

2. Launch the app from http://localhost:9999

Note: There is a huge example (8000+ files) in the branch named "remote". Check it out if you are interested in working with a remote build cache.
